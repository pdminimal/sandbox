# Sandbox

Experiments.

## Program visualizer
It is aiming to visualize the runtime process of python, including the implementation of the interpreter.

## Text segmentation
It is an experimental implementation of my unsupervised text segmentation algorithm which doesn't depend on language-specific grammar knowledge.
It has a very similar objective as [SentensePiece](https://github.com/google/sentencepiece)
